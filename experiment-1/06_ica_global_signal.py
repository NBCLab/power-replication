"""Experiment 1, Analysis Group 6.

Does TEDANA retain global BOLD signal in BOLD ICA components?

Carpet plots generated for ICA components and OC data, along with line plots for physiological
traces.

ICA components correlated with mean cortical signal of OC dataset.
-   Record the percentage and number of BOLD-like and non-BOLD-like components correlated with the
    cortical signal at r > 0.5 and r > 0.3 across participants.
-   Mean correlation coefficient for BOLD and non-BOLD components with mean cortical signal is
    calculated for each participant, and distributions of correlation coefficients were compared
    to zero and each other with t-tests.
-   Mean cortical signal from MEDN is correlated with mean cortical signal from OC for each
    participant, and distribution of coefficients is compared to zero with one-sampled t-test.
