	Averaged correlations between the mean cortical signal from optimally combined data and accepted ICA component time series (M[Z] = 0.044, SD[Z] = 0.185) were not significantly higher than zero, t(26) = 1.218, p = 0.117.
	Averaged correlations between the mean cortical signal from optimally combined data and rejected ICA component time series (M[Z] = -0.022, SD[Z] = 0.148) were not significantly higher than zero, t(28) = -0.769, p = 0.776.
	Correlations between the mean cortical signal from optimally combined data and accepted ICA component time series (M[Z] = 0.044, SD[Z] = 0.188) were not significantly higher than those of rejected components (M[Z] = -0.020, SD[Z] = 0.154), t(26) = 1.288, p = 0.105.

	Correlations between the mean cortical signal from multi-echo denoised signal and that of optimally combined data (M[Z] = 1.371, SD[Z] = 3.193) were significantly higher than zero, t(29) = 2.312, p = 0.014.
	Correlations between the mean cortical signal from multi-echo denoised signal and that of optimally combined data (M[Z] = 0.785, SD[Z] = 0.494) were significantly higher than zero, t(28) = 8.405, p = 0.000.
