	Correlations between the mean cortical signal from optimally combined data and accepted ICA component time series (M[Z] = 0.014, SD[Z] = 0.124) were not significantly higher than zero, t(28) = 0.584, p = 0.282.
	Correlations between the mean cortical signal from optimally combined data and rejected ICA component time series (M[Z] = -0.022, SD[Z] = 0.148) were not significantly higher than zero, t(28) = -0.769, p = 0.776.

	Correlations between the mean cortical signal from multi-echo denoised signal and that of optimally combined data (M[Z] = 1.371, SD[Z] = 3.193) were significantly higher than zero, t(29) = 2.312, p = 0.014.
