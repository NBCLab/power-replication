# Dataset/processing notes

## dset-cambridge

sub-04620 cannot be processed/analyzed, because the nifti file for echo-2 is corrupted.
Someone posted on OpenNeuro about this issue >1 year ago, but received no response.

## dset-dupre

I removed all cuedSGT files from the dataset because I figured that it would be easier
than filtering the dataset in all of my jobs.
